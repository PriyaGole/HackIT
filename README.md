## Applications

Hey everyone, let us now conclude the project with a [few exciting applications](http://cse.unl.edu/~choueiry/F07-235/files/NumberTheoryApplications.pdf) of the concepts you learned.  
We will go through two of the major applications, namely Pseudo Random Number Generators and Hash tables.

## Pseudo Random Number generators

A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), also known as a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG), is an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers.

To get the essence of pseudorandom numbers, you first need to understand what random numbers are.
The following videos introduce the idea of random numbers and how we generate them in real life.
> And, you would see how intricate it is for us to generate truly random numbers, and that's when pseudo-random numbers come into the picture.

## Hash Tables and Hash Functions

Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. Some examples of how hashing is used in our lives include:

- In universities, each student is assigned a unique roll number that can be used to retrieve information about them.
- In libraries, each book is assigned a unique number that can be used to determine information about the book, such as its exact position in the library or the users it has been issued to etc.

In both these examples the students and books were hashed to a unique number.

Here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyUTuwz_b7Q) to the basic introduction of Hash Tables and Hash Functions.

Hopefully, you all enjoyed the project and learned how beautiful Number Theory is. This was just an elementary introduction; you can dive even deeper as there are many things to explore further.
